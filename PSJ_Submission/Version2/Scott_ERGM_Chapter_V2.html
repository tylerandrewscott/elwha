<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   This paper examines collaborative management groups from the perspective of policymakers
seeking to increase coordination within a policy network. While governments often support
collaborative groups as a tool to address perceived network failures such as a lack of
coordination, the net impact groups have is unclear. I use valued exponential random graph
models (ERGMs) to model relationships of varying strength amongst a regional network of
organizations involved in 57 collaborative groups. This provides a unique opportunity to study
the interplay between numerous groups and organizations within a large-scale network.
Valued ERGMs are a recently developed extension of standard ERGMs that model
binary ties; thus, this paper also makes a methodological contribution to the policy
literature. Findings suggest that participation in collaborative groups does motivate
stronger levels of coordination and cooperation amongst organizations network ties
between individual organizations; however, this effect is strongest for: (a) organizations
that are not already members of another group; and (b) organizations that do not
have a pre-existing tie. These results support a transaction-cost based perspective of
how government-sponsored collaborative groups can influence network coordination;
further, they also provide an empirical example of the Ecology of Games, in which
multiple collaborative institutions have interactive effects on one another within a policy
network.<br

<!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >This paper examines how government-sponsored collaborative environmental management
groups influence the structure of inter-organizational networks. Collaborative groups continue
to grow in popularity as a tool for increasing coordination amongst network actors (Margerum
2011). In theory, government-sponsored groups lower the transaction costs organizations face
with regards to forming and maintaining inter-organizational ties by subsidizing a degree of
these costs. Thus, participants in groups which facilitate &#8216;principled engagement&#8217; and increase
the &#8216;capacity for joint action&#8217; (Emerson et al. 2012) are much more likely to engage directly in
consultation, planning, or policy implementation with one another as well (CITATION
REDACTED).
<!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   In practice, when viewed at a larger scale it is unclear whether collaborative groups foster a
net increase in cooperation and coordination amongst organizations (i.e., more and stronger
inter-organizational ties) or whether they simply engender a different pattern of ties with no
net change in overall collaborative behavior (Lubell et al. 2010; Lubell &amp; Lippert
2011). Recent literature building upon the &#8220;Ecology of Games&#8221; framework (Berardo &amp;
Scholz 2010; Lubell et al. 2010; Lubell &amp; Lippert 2011; Lubell et al. 2011; McAllister
et al. 2014; Smaldino &amp; Lubell 2014; Niles &amp; Lubell 2012) shows that &#8220;any particular
collaborative process may have positive or negative feedbacks on the performance of other
policy decisions&#8217;&#8217; (Gerlak et al. 2012, p. 424). Accordingly, in light of the complex
array of existing institutions (collaborative groups and other venues) organizations
already operate within (see Lubell 2013; Lubell et al. 2011), the standard rationale for
government initiation and support of new, additional collaborative groups deserves greater
scrutiny.
<!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   This analysis is a companion piece to CITATION REDACTED, which also addresses
government-sponsored collaborative management groups employed as network interventions.
Both analyses leverage a unique dataset concerning a large scale regional network of

organizations involved 57 different collaborative management groups involved in ecosystem
restoration and recovery. However, CITATION REDACTED seeks to operationalize and test
the framework for collaborative governance developed by Emerson et al. (2012),
specifically examining the mechanisms of principled engagement and increased capacity for
joint action that are theorized to be drivers of collaborative behavior. CITATION
REDACTED tests these mechanisms using data concerning participant beliefs about
group actions and outcomes, showing a positive and significant relationship between
the extent to which a group is reported to facilitated principled engagement with
other organizations and the prevalence of coordination and cooperation amongst
group members. In contrast, this paper uses data concerning participation in group
activities to test whether participation in a collaborative group is associated with
a corresponding increase in information sharing, planning, and policy or program
implementation with other organizations. Building upon this basic question, I use
participation data from multiple groups to test whether participation in several groups
diminishes the predicted marginal impact of participation, and further use data concerning
whether a network tie existed prior to group membership to compare the extent
to which group participation serves to strengthen existing ties versus foster new
ones. The overarching goal of this paper is to examine whether there is a prima facie
case supporting the use of collaborative management groups as a tool for increasing
network coordination, particularly for complex policy networks in which organizations
already have many network ties or are members of multiple collaborative groups. I
also make a methodological contribution to the policy literature by providing an
empirical example of statistical network analysis using values to reflect network ties
of differing strengths instead of modeling a binary metric reflecting tie presence or
absence.
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   In the section to follow, I provide the background and theoretical rationale for this research.
Particularly, I define and distinguish between key terms such as networks and collaborative
groups and embed my hypotheses within the extant literature. I then describe the research
design and the recently developed method of valued-tie exponential random graph models

(ERGMs) (Krivitsky 2012; Krivitsky &amp; Butts 2013; Cranmer &amp; Desmarais 2011;
Desmarais &amp; Cranmer 2012b; Wyatt et al. 2009; Wyatt et al. 2010) I use to test my
hypotheses. After describing the survey instrument and data collection process, I present
model results. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of findings and their broader
implications, both for empirical management and for the ongoing collaborative governance
literature.

class="ecrm-1000">Broadly, networks are simply defined as &#8220;collections of actors who pursue repeated, enduring exchange relations</span>

   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">disputes that may arise during the exchange&#8221; (Podolny &amp; Page 1998, p. 59). By expanding the concept of</span>
   <span

   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">relationships, positions, or interest area&#8221; (Margerum 2011, p. 33). This definition can encompass social</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">networks (interpersonal relationships, Putnam 2000), inter-organizational networks (structures and processes in</span>
   <span

   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">Knoke 1990).</span> 
might at first seem to be completely at odds with the notion of direct government
influence and strategic public policy interventions; however, the concept of
governance<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></span> <a 
 id="x1-2002f2"></a><span class="footnote-mark"><a 
 id="fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><span 
class="ecrm-1000">"Governance" refers to a process in which public actors make policies, deliver services, or implement policies</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">within a network (or networks) of actors (Frederickson 2005; Rhodes 1997; Torfing &amp; Sorensen 2007).</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">Governance is characterized by a high degree of interdependency amongst actors and a complex</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">decision-making process (Klijn et al. 2010). Bressers (2009, p. 125) poses that "governance" is an enlargement</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">of the concept of public policy (also Bressers &amp; Kuks 2003). Thus, in keeping with the findings of Ostrom et al.</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">(1961), governance is not really a new state of affairs, but rather a basis for scientific variables that can be used</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">for empirical studies.</span> 
implies that government cannot act autonomously. Public agents must instead engage in
multi-actor processes in which it is only one of many relevant actors, as its "core purposes can
only hope to be realized in such settings" (Bressers 2009, p. 130). In other words, public
agencies still face the same problems of service delivery, but must employ different means to
achieve their desired ends.

<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   Within a network governance context, public policy makers often fulfill a role as network
manager (Klijn &amp; Koppenjan 2000); instead of carrying out tasks directly, policy makers
attempt to address collective action dilemmas indirectly by changing network rules and
influencing network relationships (Klijn &amp; Koppenjan 2006). Interorganizational (or
inter-stakeholder) collaborative groups are one of the most prominent (and well-documented)
mechanisms by which environmental policy makers attempt to alter the structure and function
of an organizational network (see Ansell &amp; Gash 2008; Emerson et al. 2012; Margerum
2011, for recent discussions). Such groups represent "a governing arrangement where
one or more public agencies directly engage non-state stakeholders in a collective
decision-making process that is formal, consensus-oriented, and deliberative and that aims to
make or implement public policy or manage public programs or assets" (Ansell &amp;
Gash 2008, p. 544) (see also Emerson et al. 2012; Imperial 2005; Margerum 2011).
Even though collaborative effort on the part of a public agency might be required
by legislative mandate, a collaborative group represents a voluntary association of
legally autonomous public, private, or non-profit organizations (Ansell &amp; Gash 2008;
Schneider et al. 2003; Lubell et al. 2002); this serves to distinguish a collaborative group
from an organization, defined in this analysis as a legally autonomous entity with a
formal hierarchical structure. Thus, a "collaborative management group" refers to
a management entity comprised of several independent organizations that uses a
deliberative structure and seeks to encompass relevant stakeholders (Ansell &amp; Gash
2008).<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></span> <a

 id="fn3x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><span 
class="ecrm-1000">Collaboration of course can also occur outside the auspices of a formal "collaborative group." Margerum (2011,</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">p. 6) defines collaboration as &#8220;an approach to solving complex problems in which a diverse group of</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">autonomous stakeholders deliberates to build consensus and develop networks for translating consensus into</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">results.&#8221;</span> 
To avoid confusion, going forward this paper uses &#8220;coordination&#8221; and &#8220;cooperation&#8221; in reference
to network ties between two organizations and reserves the term &#8220;collaboration&#8221; as a reference
specifically to collaborative management groups.

 id="x1-30003"></a><span 
class="ecbx-1200">RATIONALE</span></h3>
<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >If coordination and cooperation with other organizations is potentially advantageous, why
do organizations not always elect to do so? Assuming that network organizations
act rationally in pursuit of their interests, one might surmise then that the existing
structure and function of an organizational network reflects the landscape of costs and
benefits associated with network relationships. The benefits of inter-organizational
coordination and cooperation include heightened information access, issue understanding,
conflict reduction, and implementation support (Moreland et al. 1993; Gigone &amp; Hastie
1993; Cragan &amp; Wright 1990; Hill &amp; Lynn 2003; Susskind et al. 1999; Sabatier et al.
2005). Of course, collaboration is not always beneficial for organizations. Further,
even in cases where collaboration might be advantageous, the time and resources
required to initiate and maintain network relations can outweigh any potential benefits.
Highly practical constraints such as travel time (Thomas 2003) or there being too
many different meetings and activities for managers to attend each one (Margerum
2011) constrain inter-organizational collaboration. Researchers also often discuss
more intangible transaction costs associated with network relations, such as norms of
reciprocity (Putnam 2000) or shared beliefs and preferences (Schneider et al. 2003;
Sabatier &amp; Jenkins-Smith 1993), which also incentivize (or disincentivize) collaborative
efforts.
<!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >   Though the behavior of individual organizations ultimately depends on the particular
incentives faced and motivations held by each organization, from a policy and management
perspective existing policy network structures can prove suboptimal (i.e., &#8216;&#8217;network failure&#8221;
(Schrank &amp; Whitford 2011) or &#8216;&#8217;system failure&#8221; (Carlsson &amp; Jacobsson 1997)) in the same way
that existing market structures can lead to negative outcomes (for instance, classic market
failures such as overfishing) (Weimer &amp; Vining 2010). In particular, Schneider et al. (2003)
find that often network relations are under supplied because &#8217;the costs of creating
and maintaining networks [network ties in the context of this analysis] are high and
the benefits gained by the policy community&#x2026; are not reflected in the incentives of
individual stakeholders" (Schneider et al. 2003, p. 144). By producing outputs such as

meetings and providing administrative support for joint activities, a collaborative
group can potentially address this under supply problem by altering the transaction
cost landscape that each organization faces. The sponsoring agency is essentially
hoping that subsidizing a degree of the transaction costs related to inter-organizational
networking will engender increased collaboration. This type of intervention can create new
network content (Koppenjan &amp; Klijn 2004), guide network interactions (Kickert et al.
1997; Mandell 1990), and further inter-actor trust through facilitated interactions
(Klijn et al. 2010). For instance, Schneider et al. (2003) find evidence that federal
programs such as the National Estuary Program (which supports collaborative work with
stakeholders) can help overcome "second-level" collective action problems (i.e., those
related to coordination and cooperation) by providing funding, encouraging broader
participation, establishing a focal policy arena, and increasing legitimacy amongst network
organizations.
<!--l. 97--><p class="indent" >   Nonetheless, altering the incentive structures organizations face does not necessarily alter
the motivations and goals of said organizations (but might in the long run, as I discuss later).
Thus, the extent to which government initiation and support of collaborative management
groups increases actual inter-organizational cooperation and coordination remains an open
question. The basic hypothesis (H1) for this analysis is that participation in a collaborative
group is associated with an increase in direct coordination and cooperation with other
organizations.
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >
      <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">H1:  Participation  in  a  collaborative  group  is  associated  with  an  increase  in  direct
      coordination and cooperation with other organizations</dd></dl>
<!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   While a positive association is expected, the relative strength&#8211;or tenuousness&#8211;of the
relationship between collaborative group formation and increases in actual coordination and
cooperation amongst individual organizations, which speaks to the impact that a
government-sponsored network intervention can achieve, has not been systematically evaluated.
Further, I extend this basic hypothesis to examine conditions that are more interesting in
theory and practice. First, collaborative processes can have both positive and negative

feedbacks within a policy network (Gerlak et al. 2012), The reality that network interventions
can have both positive and negative impacts within a complex policy subsystem is one of the
overarching messages of the growing Ecology of Games literature (Berardo &amp; Scholz 2010;
Lubell et al. 2010; Lubell et al. 2011; McAllister et al. 2014; Smaldino &amp; Lubell 2014; Niles &amp;
Lubell 2012). New collaborative groups do not operate in a vacuum. Especially in highly
institutionalized settings such as the Puget Sound case I examine in this paper, organizations
not only already possess various types of ties to other network organizations, but moreover are
typically involved in a complex array of existing collaborative institutions as well (see
Lubell 2013; Lubell et al. 2011). The Ecology of Games framework (developed by
Long (1958) and reintroduced by Lubell et al. (2010)) emphasizes organizational
constraints, namely that organizations have a finite capacity for networking and
interaction with other organizations. While this capacity might change in the long
run as a function of changing organizational goals, motivations, and beliefs (e.g.,
Bingham &amp; O&#8217;Leary 2008; Innes &amp; Booher 2010; Leach &amp; Sabatier 2005; Lubell
2005), in the short run organizational &#8220;demand&#8221; for collaboration is essentially fixed.
Thus, a new collaborative group might change the existing pattern of network ties
without engendering a net increase in overall coordination within a complex policy
network (i.e., instead of keeping old ties and forming new ones, organizations drop
old ties and form new ones, resulting in a zero-sum change). This analysis does not
specifically examine organizational capacity, since my focus is on the general impacts of
a government-sponsored network intervention. Nonetheless the implications of the
Ecology of Games framework and related literature directly inform Hypothesis 2
(H2):
<!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >
      <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">H2:   Participation   in   multiple   collaborative   groups   diminishes   the   association
      between group participation and direct coordination and cooperation with other
      organizations</dd></dl>
<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   Further, network ties are often conceptually dichotomized as either &#8220;bridging&#8221; or &#8220;bonding&#8221;
ties (Berardo &amp; Scholz 2010; Berardo et al. 2014); bridging ties are &#8220;weak ties&#8221; (Granovetter

1985) that maximize information flow and bonding ties are &#8220;strong ties&#8221; characterized by high
levels of reciprocity and trust. The &#8220;information sharing&#8221; ties measured in my data are an
example of a bridging tie, while a &#8220;joint implementation&#8221; tie more closely equates to a
bonding tie (I assume that coordinated planning ties occupy a middle ground). Since
respondents are asked to report whether a given tie existed prior to their involvement
in a PSP-sponsored group (these data are discussed in greater detail below), this
indicator can be used to compare the extent to which participation in a collaborative
group serves to strengthen existing relationships versus foster new ones. Scholz et al.
(2008) find that lack of information about potential partners significantly constrains
inter-organizational coordination and cooperation in policy networks. Government-supported
collaborative groups can reduce these search costs. For organizations that have an existing
tie, however, search costs are presumably not a major barrier to having a stronger
relationship; instead, the extent to which organizational goals and motivations do not
overlap&#8211;or at least are not compatible&#8211;is likely a more prominent factor in explaining
why two organizations do not have a stronger network tie. My analysis considers
short-term network changes; while participation in a collaborative group can alter
organizational goals and beliefs in the long run (e.g., Bingham &amp; O&#8217;Leary 2008;
Leach &amp; Sabatier 2005; Lubell 2005), in the short run group participation likely
does more to reduce search costs (i.e.., increase awareness of other organizations).
Since lack of awareness better explains why two organizations have no network tie
whatsoever than it explains why two organizations do not have a stronger network tie,
my third hypothesis (H3) is that the predicted change in tie strength for any two
collaborative group participants will be diminished if two organizations have a pre-existing
tie:

class="ecbx-1200">MODEL</span></h3>
<!--l. 126--><p class="noindent" >While individual actor attributes affect network tie formation (Handcock et al. 2014b), the
very presence or absence of other ties also affects whether other network ties are
initiated, maintained, or destroyed (Lubell et al. 2012). This interdependence means
that these data violate the standard statistical assumption that observations are
independent of one another (Robins et al. 2012). Failing to account for this biases estimates
(Kolaczyk 2009; Krackhardt 1988). Thus, I use exponential-family random graph
models (ERGMs), which explicitly model tie interdependence (Lubell et al. 2012),
to address these hypotheses. The application of ERGMs to policy research is well
established in the literature (Feiock et al. 2010; Henry 2011; Lubell et al. 2012). The
basic premise of ERGMs is that the observed network (the survey results) constitute
one sample from a distribution of network graphs; I can simulate a distribution of
similar graphs (i.e., ones that on average have the same number of organizations,
inter-organizational ties, and other network structures as does the observed network) and
then compare the observed network to this distribution. If the observed number of a
specific network structure, for instance a triangle in which <span 
class="cmmi-12">y</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">ij</span></sub> <span 
class="cmr-12">= 1</span>, <span 
class="cmmi-12">y</span><sub><span

<span 
class="cmmi-12">y</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">ki</span></sub> <span 
class="cmr-12">= 1</span>, is very high relative to the typical number of said structure present in the
distribution of randomly simulated networks, then this would indicate that there is
significant "transitivity" (i.e., &#8220;a friend of my friend is my friend&#8217;&#8217;) in the observed
networks.

amongst observations is that each and every tie variable must be modeled conditionally based
upon all other ties observed in the network (Lusher et al. 2013). Because there is
an extremely large number of possible network configurations, it is not feasible to
analyze all possible graphs. Instead, the <span

implements a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure that estimates model

routine proposes a single change to the network (i.e., altering one potential tie
between two nodes) and compares the probabilities of the previous and proposed

When the probability of the proposed network is greater than the current network, the MCMC
routine chooses the proposed network and then repeats the same process; when the
probability of the proposed network is less than the current network, the MCMC
routine only chooses the proposed network a given percentage of the time (Lusher
et al. 2013). By repeating this process over and over again, the MCMC sampling
procedure converges on a stationary distribution of network graphs from which sample
graphs can be drawn to generate a basis against which to compare the observed
data.
<!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >   Whereas CITATION REDACTED and most other statistical network analyses model
binary network ties (either present or absent), this paper makes a methodological contribution
by providing an empirical example of the valued ERGM method. &#8220;Valued networks,&#8217;&#8217;
or networks with non-binary ties, are still very much an exploratory area within
statistical network analysis. Applications of valued ERGMs to non-trivial empirical
datasets are rare in the policy literature (Desmarais &amp; Cranmer 2012b; Krivitsky
2012). The binary ERGM approach (as used in CITATION REDACTED) requires
modeling each type of network tie as constituting a distinct network (e.g., a &#8220;joint
implementation&#8217;&#8217; network and a &#8220;coordinated planning&#8217;&#8217; network). Modeling valued
edges enables a more nuanced approach, specifically the ability to model one overall
network consisting of inter-organizational relationships of differing intensity (e.g.,
consultation vs. coordinated activity). This makes a great deal of empirical sense, since the
different inter-organizational ties modeled in this paper (consultation, planning, and
implementation) reflect relationships of differing intensity rather any sort of firm categorical
boundaries. Valued ties are also helpful from an analytical perspective, as it allows for

distinction between network structures consisting of more and less intensive ties. For
instance, if Organization <span 
class="ecti-1200">A </span>and Organization <span 
class="ecti-1200">C </span>both engage in policy implementation
with Organization <span 
class="ecti-1200">B</span>, we might expect the fact that <span 
class="ecti-1200">A </span>and <span 
class="ecti-1200">C </span>each have a fairly
intensive relationship with <span 
class="ecti-1200">B </span>to increase the likelihood of <span 
class="ecti-1200">A </span>and <span 
class="ecti-1200">C </span>themselves sharing a
direct tie relative to if <span 
class="ecti-1200">A </span>and <span 
class="ecti-1200">C </span>were to each have a less intensive relationship with
<span 
class="ecti-1200">B</span>.

Additional terms can then be added to the model to account for structural characteristics
of the network, or for exogenous attributes of the nodes (organizations) or edges

observed network relations produces the following specification (Krivitsky &amp; Butts

<!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   While the premise of using collaborative groups to increase inter-organizational coordination
and cooperation seems intuitive, empirically there are several issues that make supporting this

causal claim with rather difficult. Ideally, one would use either extensive longitudinal data or a
randomized experiment to estimate the causal effect. However, time series data are
difficult and costly to maintain. At this point there are not sufficient resources to
facilitate long-term longitudinal data collection, and no comparable data currently
exists. Even with sufficient resources to implement repeated surveys to such a large
organizational network, feedback received from participants in the current survey
indicates that many participants would be unwilling or unable to participate in a
more extensive study. An experimental evaluation would also likely be unfeasible.
Conducting a randomized controlled trial is simply not realistic for such a large scale policy
network; it is difficult to envision successfully implementing a randomized experiment in
which some organizations in a region are invited to participate in a management or
decision-making process while others are not. Further, the dependent variable(s) in a
network analysis are ties between units (organizations in this case), not characteristics
of individual units. This quite obviously violates the Stable Unit Treatment Value
Assumption (SUTVA) (Rubin 1986; Pearl 2000), as the network behavior of each
organization (whether in the treatment or the control group) affects that of every other
organization.
<!--l. 150--><p class="indent" >   The model specified above is applied to observational data (described in detail below).
Thus, any estimates of the association between collaborative group participation and
increased consultation, planning, and implementation with other organizations are
potentially biased upwards due to confounding. For instance, it is possible that unobserved
characteristics, namely the motivation to form ties with other organizations, are
positively correlated with both collaborative group participation (the &#8220;treatment&#8217;&#8217;
variable) and the formation of network ties (the outcome variable) (i.e., confounding).
This would bias estimates upwards because organizations who participate in groups
would also be more likely to report inter-organizational ties in general regardless
of their participation in a group. The inappropriateness of regression models for
network data (Kolaczyk 2009; Krackhardt 1988) precludes the use of traditional
regression-based methods, such as propensity score matching, used to control for omitted

variable bias and estimate causal effects with observational data. Thus, I employ a
deductive, stepwise modeling approach to address potential confounding, as well
as the possibility of reverse causality (that organizations tied to one another join
the same groups, rather than vice-versa). Further, I also account for the practical
consideration of bandwidth limitations (that ties switch according to group membership
without a net increase overall) in light of the large number of institutional venues
that most organizations have access to (Berardo &amp; Scholz 2010; Lubell et al. 2010;
Lubell et al. 2011; McAllister et al. 2014; Smaldino &amp; Lubell 2014; Niles &amp; Lubell
2012; Gerlak et al. 2012). As these data concern a large number of organizations and
collaborative groups active within the region, I am able to control for existing group
membership patterns and thus avoid overstating the gains attributable to the focal network
intervention.
<!--l. 152--><p class="indent" >   Fitting a series of ERGMs with different specifications for group participation and past
network ties allows me to triangulate a potential effect. While this method cannot eliminate
potential bias, the estimates provided herein present prima facie evidence for the use of
collaborative groups to enhance inter-organizational networks. Given the lack of more rigorous
experimental designs, these data are the best available evidence for policymakers to date. I
further discuss my empirical approach within the Analysis and Results sections. In
the interim, the following section describes the case selection and data gathering
process.

<!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >The analyzed case is that of the Puget Sound Partnership (PSP), an agency in Washington
state created in 2007 that is confusingly named because it is a public agency, not an
inter-organizational partnership. The PSP is tasked with improving coordination and enhancing
collaboration in Puget Sound ecosystem restoration and recovery efforts. As part of its efforts
the PSP has initiated or significantly funded 34 different local and regional collaborative

groups. What makes this particularly interesting is that the Puget Sound region already had
numerous active collaborative groups prior to 2007 in which many organizations were involved
(see CITATION REDACTED) . Thus, PSP-initiated groups exist within a broader
context of organizational ties and other collaborative groups as well. This is likely
emblematic of the type of environment encountered throughout the US and other highly
institutionalized settings, where organizations have many opportunities for networking and
must make trade-offs (e.g., which meeting to attend or which organizations to work
with) due to time and resource constraints (Lubell et al. 2010). Thus, I also use data
concerning membership in 23 local and regional collaborative groups that predate the
PSP&#8217;s network intervention in order to account for existing group membership and
participation. In particular, I am interested in whether this mitigates the predicted
impact of membership and participation in a PSP group. In total, the sample frame
encompasses the membership of 57 local and regional collaborative groups, which provides a
comprehensive picture of the overall network inside and outside the sphere of PSP
sponsorship.
<!--l. 158--><p class="indent" >   The survey instrument uses a &#8220;hybrid name generator&#8221; technique (Henry et al. 2012; Lubell
et al. 2011) in which each respondent is asked to list up to five organizations with which they
regularly engage in: (1) joint projects or program implementation (given that many
organizations are consulting, funding, or administrative support bodies, this includes activities
such as permitting assistance); (2) coordinated planning or strategy development; and (3)
informal consultation (e.g., information sharing) (CITATION REDACTED). Thus, each
respondent could potentially list up to 15 organizations in total, 5 for each type of collaborative
activity. The total number of responses for each category are limited to emphasize regular,
substantive organizational ties (and make survey completion tractable). The survey
instrument also produced data on whether or not each reported tie existed prior to
the PSP&#8217;s intervention and each respondents&#8217; level of participation in collaborative
groups.
<!--l. 160--><p class="indent" >   As some group coordinators are unwilling to share their group email lists, the survey
response rate must be estimated using published membership rosters. I estimate that the 57

collaborative groups sampled encompass 1600 total members (see also CITATION
REDACTED). However, many organizations maintain membership in multiple collaborative
groups; thus, 902 unique individuals are identified. Further, there are 100 group positions
without any published name attached (e.g., groups rosters list only positions, such
as &#8220;municipal representative,&#8221; and no name or organization); to be conservative, I
assume that each of these unnamed positions correspond to a unique individual, thus
producing a total population estimate of 1002. Of these 1002 individuals, 498 accessed
the survey instrument. Because 63 respondents did not identify the organization
they represent, and 35 did not complete the portion of the survey in which they
were asked to identify network ties, the sample used for this analysis comprises 400
individuals (a response rate of around 40%). These 400 individuals represent 221 unique
organizations.<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">7</sup></span> <a

<!--l. 167--><p class="noindent" >The basic premise of the ERGM approach that networks are not static and that an observed
network configuration is a realization of an ongoing, dynamic process (Lusher et al. 2013).
Accordingly, the observed structure is just one realization from amongst all of the possible
structures that could be observed (e.g., imagine the observed network but with one more
inter-organizational tie). An ERGM facilitates statistical inference on the processes that drive
network structure by considering the set of all possible network configurations, and
comparing the observed configuration (the network as revealed by the data) to this
theoretical set (placing extra weight on possible configurations that bear increased
similarity to the observed configuration). Whereas a standard regression model works&#8211;in
theory&#8211;even in the absence of control variables, hypothesis testing using an exogenous
(i.e., non-structural) variable in an ERGM model first requires inductively fitting a
baseline model that adequately describes the observed network; the variable of interest
can then be added to the baseline model to see if it also accounts for a significant
portion of the observed variance (Kolaczyk 2009; Lusher et al. 2013). In other words,
generating a baseline ERGM is a &#8220;trial-and-error process&#8221; (Lusher et al. 2013, p. 184)
that requires a series of stepwise modeling fittings to develop an optimal baseline
model to which terms testing the independent variable(s) of interest can then be
added.
<!--l. 169--><p class="indent" >   Snijders et al. (2006) and Lusher et al. (2013) provide a set of &#8220;structural&#8221; parameters
that are recommended as a starting place for fitting ERGMs Structural parameters
represent endogenous effects that result due to self-organization within the network
independent of actor attributes or characteristics (Lusher et al. 2013). One might think of
these structural parameters as capturing the &#8220;basic processes&#8221; of networking, such
as the tendency for popular organizations to attract more ties simply by virtue of
being popular, or for the propensity of group-like structures such as triangles to form
amongst related organizations (Lusher et al. 2013). While specific types of drivers are of
differing importance in different networks, one can model a network by starting with the
recommended set of general structural terms (as well as any exogenous variables that are
theorized to be relevant) and then removing terms that are not significant or that do not

contribute to model fit (Snijders et al. 2006). Accordingly, the model presented in Table 1
shows the &#8220;best-fit&#8221; baseline model produced via this process (without the variables of
interest).
<!--l. 171--><p class="indent" >   ERGMs are fit using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure in which a possible
network configuration is generated and then successively updated (e.g., change the value of one
tie); the model then samples from the MCMC &#8220;chain&#8217;&#8217; (the ongoing sequence of perturbed
configurations) to generate a distribution of configurations against which the observed network
is compared. The primary challenge in developing a baseline model is ensuring that an ERGM
does not become degenerate, a condition which occurs when the MCMC fitting processes
cascades towards a completely empty (no ties) or a completely full (every possible tie)
configuration and thus places most or all of the weighting on these unrealistic possibilities
(Handcock 2003; Kolaczyk 2009). This basic explanation as to why this happens is that as the
iterative fitting process changes one tie, it can simultaneously affect the likelihood associated
with multiple network structures (such as triangles, multi-tie paths, etc.), and if this
continually happens the model will head towards the empty or full network rather
than fully exploring the parameter space. Of particular issue in non-binary (i.e.,
valued-edge) ERGMs is that the parameter sample space is unbounded depending on
the configuration of parameters used, and thus the simulated parameter values can
simply keep decreasing or increasing across iterations (Krivitsky &amp; Butts 2013).
By viewing trace plots of the MCMC process, one can verify whether the models
&#8220;mix&#8221; adequately or whether they stray outside of the parameter space (Krivitsky
2012).
<!--l. 173--><p class="indent" >   Figure 1 shows traceplots for each parameter across iterations of the MCMC

   <span

   <span

   <span

discuss the interpretation of each parameter below. Each line in Figure 1 shows how the

maximum likelihood estimate for each parameter changed as each chain progressed. The
seemingly random, haphazard path of the chains for each parameter evidence that the model is
searching throughout the parameter space and not converging to the full or empty network.
This shows that the MCMC process is sampling from a stable distribution and is not
degenerate.
<!--l. 175--><p class="noindent" >[Figure&#x00A0;1&#x00A0;about here.]
<!--l. 184--><p class="indent" >   Further, Figure 2 shows smoothed parameter density plots from each MCMC
run. As shown, each chain produces a unimodal distribution and generally speaking,
the 8 chains produce similar distributions for each parameter. The x-axis values in
Figure 2 represent the difference between the observed network statistics and the
network statistics for each iteration of the MCMC routine. One can verify model
convergence by seeing that the density plot for each parameter (normalized by the
observed statistic) has a mean near zero and is normally distributed; in other words,
the model has converged to the observed network. In this case, one observes that
most distributions are centered closely to zero and appear to be roughly normally
distributed.<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">9</sup></span> <a

class="ecrm-1000">Ideally, the distributions for each of the 8 chains would be completely congruent; in practice, however, this is</span>
   <span

   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">hours to fit on a high-performance Linux server cluster. It is expected that were each chain run for a sufficient</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">amount of samples, the distributions would converge. This assumption was tested by comparing the model</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">fitting results presented in this paper to those of models with a smaller MCMC sample size; as the number of</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">samples per chain increases from 2250 to 6250 (i.e., from 10,000 total samples to 50,000 total samples), the</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">parameter distributions for each chain become more congruent. Further, it is important to note that many</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">published ERGMs do not fit MCMC chains in parallel, and instead simply examine whether the single</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">distribution for each parameter is normally distributed and centered on zero. Even though the</span>
   <span 
class="ecrm-1000">distributions in Figure 2 do not completely overlap, the fact that they show relatively consistent</span>
   <span

Most importantly, the overall mean in each case appears to be centered near zero as
well, which demonstrates that the fitted model nicely approximates the observed
data.

<!--l. 197--><p class="noindent" >Table 1 presents the restricted model with only structural and actor-related control variables. It
is helpful to interpret these parameters because it helps reveal how the model actually works.
First, the model includes three &#8220;structural&#8221; parameters, &#8220;Sum,&#8221; &#8220;Mutual,&#8221; and &#8220;Transitive
Weights.&#8221; Each coefficient is interpreted as an additive effect on the natural log of the expected
tie value (which can thus be exponentiated to produce a more easily interpretable
multiplicative effect). The Sum parameter is a measure of network density, as it
reflects the total sum of tie values observed in the network. For instance, a network
with more joint implementation ties (each having a value of 3) will have a higher
density than a network with more informal consultation ties (each having a value
of 1). The strongly negative Sum parameters in Table 1 show the network is very
sparse. Specifically, the parameter can be exponentiated to show that the expected
tie value between two randomly selected organizations is <span 
class="cmr-12">0</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">.</span><span 
class="cmr-12">015 </span>(<span

class="cmr-12">= 0</span><span

class="cmr-12">015</span>)
(Krivitsky 2012). Whereas in a binary ERGM this value would refer to an odds ratio
(<span 
class="cmmi-12">p</span><span 
class="cmr-12">(</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">y</span><sub><span

the tie (<span

class="cmmi-12">.</span><span 
class="cmr-12">015</span>). It is expected that the expected value is quite low in this
case, simply because most organizations in the network do not have any type of
tie to most other organizations (with 221 organizations there are 48,620 potential
ties).

represents the change in probability of observing a tie between two organizations, for instance a
tie from A to B, given an observed tie from B to A. The observed values for &#8220;mutuality&#8221; in
the data are taken to be the minimum value or count of the two reciprocal dyads
(<span 
class="cmmi-12">min</span><span

class="cmmi-8">i,j</span></sub><span 
class="cmmi-12">,y</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">j,i</span></sub>). As expected, this shows a strong and significant correlation between both the
tie counts associated with a network dyad. In other words, I would expect A to be
much more likely to report a tie to B given that B has already reported a tie to A
(consider the informational jump in this case from the basic probability associated
with two randomly selected organizations). The expected value of a tie from one
organization to another increases by <span

class="cmr-12">47</span>) for each tie observed in the
opposite direction. Given that there are many potential network partners in this
network, it seems reasonable to presume that defection risk is relatively high; this
result then appears to be in keeping the Berardo &amp; Scholz (2010) Risk Hypothesis,
which predicts that reciprocity (i.e., mutual ties) will be favored over bridging ties in
networks where defection risk is high. The avoidance of asymmetrical ties (i.e., high
levels of reciprocity) has already been shown specifically in estuary networks very
similar to those analyzed in this paper by Berardo &amp; Scholz (2010) and Desmarais &amp;
Cranmer (2012a) (and Puget Sound generally is one of the sub-cases considered in both
analyses).

result is also in keeping the Berardo &amp; Scholz (2010) hypothesis, since transitivity
(wherein closure tends to occur such that two-paths become triangles in which all
three nodes are linked) is also assumed to be more prominent when defection risk is
greater.
<!--l. 206--><p class="indent" >   The baseline model also fits four node-specific variables that are predicted to
affect the probability of observing ties associated with a given node. The Number of
Respondents (Num. Resp.) parameter reflects the predicted impact on the expected value
of a tie associated with an organization that has an additional respondent in the
survey. This parameter should be positive, since having an additional respondent
increases the number of ties that can possibly be reported by an organization. As
expected, this parameter is significant and positive, predicting a <span

the magnitude of this suggested relationship is minimal (only a <span

number of years a respondent has been at their position and the value of a network tie.
This parameter is small, but positive, with each year predicting a 1% increase in

the value of a tie (<span

expected tie value to similar organizations. Specifically, organizations are coded as
15 different types of organizations, including state agencies, consulting firms, and
tribes.<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">13</sup></span>   <a

<!--l. 211--><p class="noindent" >The second column (Group Participation) of Table 1 adds a generic collaborative group
participation metric to the restricted baseline model shown in Column 1 (Baseline Model). Of
course, simply being a member of a group does not necessarily speak to the degree to which an
organization actually participates. Instead one would expect that inter-organizational
transaction costs are reduced in proportion to the degree of participation, and further that the
strength of the association between group membership and tie formation should
be commensurate with the degree to which organizations actually participate in
collaborative groups. In order to test this, group participation is measured in terms reported
engagement in seven different group activities for each group in which a respondent reports
membership: (1) send or respond to group emails; (2) attend group meetings; (3)
attend other group events; (4) participate in group projects or programs; (5) read or
review group reports and documents; (6) produce group reports or documents; and (7)
other types of participation. This value is then divided by 7 to produce a fractional
measure of participation in a given group. This per-group participation measure

is then summed to produce an overall measure of group participation for a given
organization.<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">14</sup></span>   <a

The Group Participation model (Column 2) in Table 1 supports H1, suggesting that
participation in a collaborative group does increase direct coordination and cooperation with
other group members. However, while this parameter is shown to be positive and significantly
different from zero, it appears to be of limited practical significance: a one-unit increase in
group participation increases the expected value of a tie involving the focal organization by <span

 id="x1-100006.4"></a>Diminishing Returns</h4>
<!--l. 216--><p class="noindent" >One likely reason that the predicted impact of group participation is small in magnitude is that
a linear participation metric does not account for potential that, as predicted by H2, there are
likely to be diminishing returns associated with a marginal increase in group membership and
participation (Lubell et al. 2010). Recent policy literature discussing how organizations
operate within complex institutional environments (e.g., Lubell 2013; Berardo &amp;
Scholz 2010), along with empirical findings regarding the practical limitations most
managers and officials face (Thomas 2003; Margerum 2011), both demonstrate that
organizations have a limited capacity for collaborative activities (Lubell et al. 2010). Thus,
a government-sponsored collaborative group intended to further enhance network
coordination might actually motivate organizations to reallocate their existing efforts across
these multiple arenas without a net increase. As a basic test, the third column of

Table 1 (Group Participation<sup><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></sup>) shows a model with an additional quadratic term for
group participation. In this model, the predicted linear association between group
participation and tie occurrence becomes much stronger, predicted a <span 
class="cmr-12">12% </span>increase in
expected tie value (<span 
class="cmmi-12">exp</span><sup><span 
class="cmr-8">0</span><span

class="cmr-12">= 1</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">.</span><span 
class="cmr-12">12</span>), and the quadratic term is very small in magnitude
but negative. In other words, participation in a collaborative group does strongly
predict an increase in tie values associated with the participating organization, but this
predicted increase diminishes as the number of groups the organization participates in
increases.
<!--l. 218--><p class="indent" >   Whereas the quadratic term in Table 1 tests this phenomenon generally (by examining
overall participation in Puget Sound area collaborative groups regardless of origin), I examine
the PSP&#8217;s intervention specifically by dividing the Group Participation variable shown in Table
1 into two categories: participation in non-PSP affiliated groups (i.e., those in existence prior to
the network intervention) and participation in PSP sponsored groups. Because these data are
observational, I am unable to eliminate the possibility that group participation and
inter-organizational collaboration are both products of unobserved organizational
characteristics such as motivation to engage with other organizations. There are
certainly organizations for whom both participation in collaborative groups and direct
coordination/cooperation with other organizations is more beneficial, and organizations for
whom both of these activities are less beneficial. What I seek to examine in this analysis,
however, is whether there is an observable impact of government-sponsored collaborative
groups net of these inherent characteristics. In other words, regardless of organizational
&#8220;demand&#8221; for collaboration, does the the predicted strength of an inter-organizational
relationship change in association with a marginal change in collaborative group
participation? Using a series of additional model specifications, this relationship is
triangulated using a series of progressively stricter coding schemes and comparing the
coefficients.
<!--l. 220--><p class="indent" >   Table 2 shows the results of three models. Column 1 (Generic Participation) in Table 2
presents a model fitting participation (coded using the same process as described above) in
non-PSP groups, participation in PSP groups, and a term interacting participation in each

group type (the base parameters are omitted in these and subsequent tables, but are included
in all models). These results support H2, showing that participation in either type
of group (measured simply in terms of the level of reported engagement in group
activities) is positively associated with the expected value of an inter-organizational tie,
but that there are diminishing returns to participation in both types of groups. In
other words, the association between group participation and the expected value of a
network tie diminishes to the extent that the organizations involved in PSP-sponsored
groups already participated in non-PSP groups. This indicates that the PSP&#8217;s network
intervention had the greatest impact on organizations that were not already heavily
involved in collaborative groups. Pragmatically, this makes a great deal of sense;
organizations more heavily involved in collaborative groups prior to the network intervention
presumably already had greater opportunity to engage with and initiate ties to other
organizations.

<!--l. 229--><p class="indent" >   The next two models in Table 2 present increasingly stringent ways of coding for group
participation. If participation in collaborative groups is a driver of inter-organizational
networking, then the impact of a collaborative group should primarily be experienced with
regards to organizations that are actually members of the same group. In other words, while
collaborative groups might certainly increase awareness of and access even to other
organizations that are not in the same group, it stands to reason that the association between
participation and network ties should be concentrated amongst organizations who actually are
members of the same group. Thus, I create a &#8216;&#8217;Direct Participation&#8217;&#8217; measure, by
conditioning total participation on group membership. Each organization is given a
distinct Direct Participation score to every other organization. This score is zero if

the organizations do not share a group. If two organizations do share at least one
group, then the Direct Participation score from Organization A to Organization
B reflects group participation reported by Organization A within groups of which
Organization B is also a member. If group participation and inter-organizational
networking are confounded by a common cause, then the predicted association between the
general metric &#8216;&#8217;Group Participation&#8221; and the occurrence of network ties (column
one) should not be meaningfully different than the predicted association between
&#8220;Direct Participation&#8221; and the occurrence of network ties (column two). However,
what I observe in Table 2 is that the coefficients become much stronger. A one unit
increase in general Group Participation in a PSP-affiliated group increases the predicted
value of a network tie by <span 
class="cmr-12">13% </span>(<span

class="cmr-12">36</span>).
<!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >   While Direct Participation focuses on organizations that actually share group membership,
the theoretical mechanisms by which collaborative groups are hypothesized to reduce
transaction costs (and thus engender increased inter-organizational collaboration) holds that
collaboration is motivated by &#8216;&#8217;principled engagement&#8217;&#8217; and &#8216;&#8217;increased capacity for joint
action&#8217;&#8217; (Emerson et al. 2012). In other words, by engaging directly with one another,
organizations build trust and learn more about one another&#8217;s needs, interests, and capabilities,
thereby decreasing the costs associated with searching for, initiating, and maintaining network
ties. Practically speaking, this can only occur if both organizations &#8220;show up&#8221; and actually
encounter one another in group activities. Thus, I code a third metric, &#8216;&#8217;Co-Participation,&#8217;&#8217; in
which the covariate associated with each possible pair of organizations is the minimum
combined Direct Participation measure shared by the two organizations (column
three). For instance, if Organization A and Organization B are both members of
one group, in which A participates in five of seven activities and B participates in
three of seven, then the Co-Participation score for dyad AB (and for dyad BA) is

The coefficients in column three of Table 2 are even stronger than those in column two. A one

<!--l. 233--><p class="indent" >   As with the generic participation metric tested in column one of Table 2, the stricter
participation metrics fit in columns two and three also speak to the diminishing returns
associated with greater levels of participation. Specifically, the negative interaction terms shows
a lessened participation effect when an organization participates in both kinds of groups. It
seems reasonable to expect, for instance, that if two organizations both participate in all
possible activities for the same two collaborative groups, then shared participation in a new
additional group is unlikely to make as much of a difference in terms of increasing familiarity
between the two organizations. One note of caution, however, is that the negative
interaction parameters imply that at very high levels, participation can have the perverse
effect of decreasing predicted tie strength; conceptually, while it seems reasonable to
assume to assume that participation in too many groups can diminish the predicted
impact on tie strength to the point that the predicted impact of a marginal increase
in participation is zero, it is difficult to come up with a rationale for high levels of
shared participation predicting lower tie strength than exists between two randomly
selected organizations in the network (excepting some sort of interpersonal conflict
engendered by too much interaction, which is not addressed by these data). Thus,
it is likely that these results reflect a somewhat localized marginal effect estimate
and not a wholly linear relationship in which too much participation has a perverse
effect.
<!--l. 235--><p class="indent" >   While these observational data cannot eliminate the role of selection bias (namely, that

organizations that are more willing to participate in collaborative groups tend to also be more
willing to engage in direct collaboration with other organizations), by modeling increasingly
strict conceptions of group participation I am able to establish that the predicted relationship
between group participation and the level of inter-organizational collaboration is strongest
among organizations that both participate to a similar extent in the same group(s). This
suggests that the collaborative group itself has some role in driving network structure,
net of intrinsic organizational characteristics. While this is by no means conclusive
evidence about the causal effect of sponsoring collaborative management groups, these
results are what one would expect to observe if providing increased opportunities for
organizations to engage with one another does in fact engender increased inter-organizational
collaboration. Realistically, it is likely both that this occurs and that some confounding is
present.

<!--l. 240--><p class="noindent" >One potential contributor to the overall magnitude of the Direct Participation and
Co-Participation parameters is the combined sparsity of the overall network and the
informational value these parameters provide about the network proximity of any two
organizations. Specifically, it is plausible that instead of forming relationships within
collaborative groups, organizations invite other organizations with whom they already engage
to participate in groups. In one sense, this would represents reverse causality, in which network
relationships drive collaborative group participation, rather than the other way around.
However, the possibility that existing network relationships drive group participation does not
rule out the possibility that group participation alters the strength of these existing
relationships. In other words, an organization might join a group because it already coordinates
or cooperates with other group members, but group participation might still serve to deepen
these relationships. Strengthening existing patterns of coordination and cooperation
might even be the goal of a network intervention. For this reason, H3 contrasts the

predicted effect of group participation on tie strength between two members who share a
pre-existing tie with the predicted effect on two members who do not share a pre-existing
tie.

<!--l. 246--><p class="indent" >   In order to test this, the survey instrument asked each respondent to report whether each
reported inter-organizational tie had existed prior to the PSP&#8217;s network intervention (i.e., more
than five years ago). This provides a rough approximation as to whether a network tie predates
the intervention (the exception being in cases where the tie was initiated within the
last five years, but prior to the organization becoming a group member). While this
does not provide as robust a picture as would a true longitudinal analysis, it does
provide a general gauge of the extent to which reverse causality might be at play by
comparing how the association between group participation and inter-organizational ties
differs between ties that existed prior to the PSP&#8217;s intervention and those that did
not.
<!--l. 248--><p class="indent" >   Table 3 presents results from a model that includes all of the covariates specified
in the baseline model and adds four additional parameters. First, the model fits a
binary term for each potential dyad (pair of organizations) that reflects whether
the tie reported from Organization A to Organization B was reported to exist prior
to the PSP&#8217;s network intervention. For a binary network, it would not be feasible
to use this metric, since the metric would be a perfect predictor of the affirmative
presence of a tie (but not tie absence, since more newly formed ties are reported as
well)<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">16</sup></span>   <a 
 id="x1-11001f16"></a><span class="footnote-mark"><a 
 id="fn16x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">16</sup></a></span><span 
class="ecrm-1000">Of the 1045 ties observed in the data, 581 are reported to be ties that predate the network intervention.</span> .
However, since this analysis models valued network ties, it can examine how the fact that a tie
was also reported to exist before the network intervention impacts the expected value of the tie

after the intervention. Given the self-reinforcing nature of network relations (Desmarais &amp;
Cranmer 2012b), one might also expect that on average, ties that existed five years ago should
be stronger than ties that did not. As expected, this parameter is positive and very strong in
magnitude; this result is not substantively interesting, however, since past ties reported
in the survey instrument are restricted to currently existing ties. Table 3 then fits
both a linear and a quadratic term for Co-Participation in both PSP and non-PSP
groups. This metric is calculated in the exact same way as the metrics in column
three of Table 2, but in this case combines participation in both types of group.
As in Table 2, the linear parameter is positive and strong in magnitude, and the
quadratic parameter is negative, again demonstrating a diminishing marginal predicted
association.
<!--l. 250--><p class="indent" >   The primary parameter of interest in Table 3 is the fourth parameter, an interaction
term between co-participation in collaborative groups and the fact that a tie was
reported to have existed prior to the PSP&#8217;s network intervention. This parameter is
negative and large in magnitude; that a tie of any value existed prior to the network
intervention decreases the association between co-participation in a collaborative group
and the value of a network tie by <span 
class="cmr-12">69% </span>(<span 
class="cmmi-12">exp</span><sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">-</span><span

class="cmr-12">= 0</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">.</span><span 
class="cmr-12">41</span>). In other words, shared
participation in a collaborative group has much less impact on the strength of a
relationship between two organizations who already engaged in some level of coordination
or cooperation prior to joining the group. Note however that the strong positive
relationship between co-participation and tie strength amongst organizations that did not
have a tie prior to the network intervention remains. This supports the conceptual
expectation of H3: in the short term collaborative groups are more likely to foster
new bridging ties (or &#8220;weak ties&#8221;) amongst participants than to increase the level of
coordination and cooperation amongst existing network partners (e.g., transition from a
bridging tie to a bonding tie). In a practical sense, these results also indicate that the
relationship between collaborative group participation and network ties works in
both direction; organizations that share a network tie are more likely to join and
participate in the same collaborative group, and organizations that join and participate in

the same collaborative group are likely to increase the strength of their network
relationship.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7   </span> <a 
 id="x1-120007"></a>Discussion/Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 255--><p class="noindent" >While it is clear that governments are beginning to intervene to address perceived network
failures just as they seek to remedy market failures and other institutional shortcomings, there
is not yet a large body of knowledge built up surrounding the use of various policy tools for
network interventions. This analysis builds on the work of Schneider et al. (2003), who
demonstrate the overall change in network conditions associated with a network intervention by
government actors (e.g., denser networks), and Henry (2011), who model the role of
social capital as a driver of policy network structure, by examining the relationship
between government network interventions and the network behavior of individual
organizations. These results advance the growing body of network-related policy theory by
developing a transaction cost-based perspective of government network interventions.
Specifically, I find a strong positive association between participation in collaborative
groups and the number&#8211;and intensity&#8211;of inter-organizational ties an organization has.
This evidences how government intervention in a policy network is associated with
changes in network structure and function and complement the findings of CITATION
REDACTED, which examines the specific mechanisms by which collaborative groups
are hypothesized to reduce the transaction costs organizations face with regards to
networking (and thus motivate the formation and maintenance of network ties). By
modeling the comparative intensity of an inter-organizational relationship (consultation,
planning, or implementation), this analysis is able to model this relationship in a
more nuanced fashion than does the policy network literature using binary ERGMs
(e.g., CITATION REDACTED, Lubell et al. 2012; Gerber et al. 2013; Schneider
et al. 2003). Thus, I make a methodological contribution to the policy literature by
providing one of the first empirical demonstrations of valued ERGM analysis in policy

research.
<!--l. 257--><p class="indent" >   Second, discussions of policy networks often overlook the fact that&#8211;particularly in highly
institutionalized contexts&#8211;organizations are faced with numerous networking opportunities and
are limited in their ability both to engage in collaborative groups and to maintain ties with
individual organizations Lubell et al. (2010) and Lubell et al. (2011). that In spite of the
rapacious growth of collaborative institutions in practice, organizations do in fact have a finite
capacity for networking. The Ecology of Games literature (e.g., Berardo &amp; Scholz 2010; Lubell
et al. 2010; Lubell &amp; Lippert 2011; Lubell et al. 2011; McAllister et al. 2014; Smaldino &amp; Lubell
2014; Niles &amp; Lubell 2012) thus predicts that in some contexts, a network intervention might
simply induce organizations to switch the decision-making venue(s) in which they
participate or change network partners without engendering an net increase in network
coordination. This analysis provides a real-world example supporting this theoretical
contention, showing that the predicted effect of group participation on tie strength
diminishes with each additional group in which an organization participates. For
policymakers, this reveals a need to fashion context-appropriate network interventions
in order to have the greatest possible impact and avoid just shuffling the deck. It
is important to recognize instances where there are already numerous&#8211;if not too
many&#8211;collaborative venues, and thus a new network intervention is likely to have diminished
returns.
<!--l. 259--><p class="indent" >   Third, I find that in the short run, collaborative group participation is a stronger predictor
of new tie formation than it is of strengthened existing ties. I argue that this is because the
short term impacts of collaborative group participation do more to alleviate search costs than
to align organizational goals and beliefs. Lack of information about potential network partners
is shown to greatly constrain network coordination and cooperation (Scholz et al. 2008);
participation in a collaborative group can increase awareness of other organizations (actions,
goals, capabilities, etc.) and directly reduce search costs. If two organizations are highly
compatible but previously unaware of this compatibility, shared group participation might
lead to the formation of a new, strong network tie (e.g., joint policy or program
implementation in this model). For organizations who share an existing tie prior to

participating in the same collaborative group, however, search costs would not seem to be a
major barrier to a stronger relationship. One might expect then that the reason two
organizations with an existing tie engage in informal consultation rather than coordinated
planning is due to other factors, such as a lack of commonality. Collaborative group
participation likely does little to address something such as lack of commonality,
at least in the short term. Accordingly, these results suggest that in the short run,
government sponsored collaborative groups do more to influence the formation of
new network ties than they do to strengthen existing patterns of coordination and
cooperation.
<!--l. 261--><p class="indent" >   Going forward, longitudinal network data that track the formation and maintenance
collaborative ties over time are likely critical for fully understanding these issues. Though it is
expensive and difficult to collect repeated measures network data (even in collecting these
cross-sectional data, the author encountered many practitioners who were too busy to
participate and had too many competing demands on their time), a longitudinal perspective is
required to better understand network dynamics over time and trace the long-term impact of
public policy interventions. As stated, this analysis examines only the short run effect of a
network intervention; that is, I assume that a publicly sponsored collaborative group subsidizes
transaction costs&#8211;making network ties &#8220;cheaper&#8221; in a general sense&#8211;and then test whether
this theoretical cost reduction motivates increased inter-organizational networking.
However, there is evidence that interaction and dialogue with other organizations also
influences goals and beliefs (Bingham &amp; O&#8217;Leary 2008; Innes &amp; Booher 2010; Leach
&amp; Sabatier 2005; Lubell 2005); in other words, a network intervention might alter
the demand for network ties in the long run by changing organizational goals and
motivations. While this analysis finds that collaborative groups do more to foster new
ties rather than strengthen old ones in the short term (H3), it is possible that the
long term impacts are different. Accordingly, longitudinal data tracking network ties
over a longer time period by sampling at multiple points might speak more fully to
the extent to which government can motivate inter-organizational coordination and
cooperation.

<!--l. 263--><p class="indent" >   In a similar fashion, more detailed network metrics, such as time spent working in concert
or resource transfers between organizations, would also contribute further to our understanding
of the role that publicly sponsored collaborative groups play in policy networks&#8211;and whether
such network interventions achieve their intended purposes. One element of particular relevance
in this regard are the interpersonal ties that exist alongside&#8211;and potentially interact
with&#8211;inter-organizational ties. Within a given policy network, we might expect that individuals
have shared interests, similar training, and other commonalities; especially in instances where
individuals move from one network organization to another (e.g., a public manager joining a
consulting firm), individual-level factors might play a large role in inter-organizational
networking.
